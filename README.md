# Natural-Language-Processing

In this project, I have two datasets. The first dataset displays the listings on an airbnb website, i.e., places to stay at. The second dataset contains the reviews for those listings.

Combining these two datasets, I predict the rating based on the review that a user has given to a place. Using nltk and textblob to get the sentiment score after the data has been cleaned where stop words have been removed along with punctuation marks and the data is lemmatized.
